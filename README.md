# Brain_HUCCs
Preprocessed single-cell sequencing data and associated code for the primary motor cortex (M1) region in Chimpanzees and Macaques.

The initial fastq data in this study were sourced from BICCN data, specifically from M1/Rhesus/download_urls.txt and M1/Chimpanzee/download_urls.txt. Subsequently, Cellranger was employed for quantitative counts using the scripts M1/Rhesus/1.fasta2counts.sh and M1/Chimpanzee/1.fasta2counts.sh. The processed data is accessible through the following link:
